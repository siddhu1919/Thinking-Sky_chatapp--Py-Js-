![JS website chat GIF](https://blog.chatengine.io/assets/per-post/nodejs-react-demo.gif)

This is a chat UI built entirely with Javascript (React specifically) ðŸ˜ƒ

All you need to run the webstie is NPM installed on your computer!

To run the website, clone the director, `cd` into it with your terminal:

## 1. Add `.env` file

Within your `.env` file, add the following with your [ChatEngine.io](ChatEngine.io) Project ID (instead of `XXXX`)

```
VITE_CHAT_ENGINE_PROJECT_ID=XXXX
```

## 2. Run the code!

```
npm install # to install all packages
npm run dev # to start the website
```

Then, your webstie will be running at http://localhost:5173/

Done ðŸŽ‰
